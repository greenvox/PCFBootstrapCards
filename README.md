# PCFBootstrapCards
This PCF control turns a list of records into bootstrap style cards. The layout of this card is driven by 6-7 columns.

<table>
    <thead>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Column 1</td>
            <td>Column 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan=2>Column 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan=2>Column 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Column 5</td>
            <td>Column 6</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
